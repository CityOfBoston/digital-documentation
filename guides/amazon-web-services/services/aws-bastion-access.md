# AWS Bastion Access

You can access the SSH Bastion from the City Hall network \(`140.241.0.0/16`\) if you have an SSH key on your AWS account and are in the `SshAccess` IAM group.

1. Get an admin to add you to the `SshAccess` IAM group.
2. From the IAM console, upload a public key for your account
3. Edit your `/etc/hosts` to add the following line: `35.169.164.239 apps-bastion`
4. Initialize your account on the bastion by SSHing without a public key: `ssh -o PubkeyAuthentication=no <username>@apps-bastion` _Note: your bastion username is the bit before `@boston.gov` on your account name._
5. Control-C out when it asks for a password.
6. SSH in with your public key: `ssh -A <username>@apps-bastion` \(the -A forwards the SSH agent, which is important for SSHing onto the instances.\)

From the Bastion, you can get to cluster machines with `ssh ec2-user@<ip-address>`. Look up the IP addresses in the EC2 console. You will need to have the ec2-user SSH private keys loaded into your SSH agent. The .pem files containing the private keys and the passwords for them can be shared to you via Dashlane.

Once youâ€™re on a container instance, you can use `docker` commands to inspect containers, and `docker exec -it <container name> /bin/sh` if you need shell access inside of one. Outside of the containers, the `ec2-user` account can use `sudo -s` to open up a shell with root access.
