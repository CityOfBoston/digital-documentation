# Microservices 2021

Microservices are webapps which perform a specific task that other applications can leverage. They are typically middleware components that enable:

1. Simplification of a webapp \(or other services\) by separating out specific tasks into a separate component, and/or 
2. Standardization and provision of the same process that can be used by multiple webapps or other services.
