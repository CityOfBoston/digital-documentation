# AgilePoint: Adding Users

Send an email to iamsupport@boston.gov to request a TEST and/or Dev Access Boston account

Note: HCM only periodically refreshes their non-Prod environments. If an employee is new they may not be there and will need a random user account. Sponsored accounts are not replicated down into lower environments but accounts can be created for them.

Users need to log in to Test Access Boston here [https://access-test.boston.gov/](https://access-test.boston.gov/)

or

Users need to log in to Dev Access Boston here [https://access-boston-dev.digital-staging.boston.gov/](https://access-boston-dev.digital-staging.boston.gov/)

Select "Ping Federate" to login in & authenticate
