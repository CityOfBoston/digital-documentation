# Step 1: Development environment

For learning about Drupal from the ground up, ee recommend using Acquia Dev Desktop as a local development environment: [https://www.acquia.com/products-services/dev-desktop](https://www.acquia.com/products-services/dev-desktop%20). 

Dev Desktop gives you the option to connect to a site hosted in the cloud; but for training purposes, you should set up a standalone site that is not synced up to the City of Boston site in any way.
