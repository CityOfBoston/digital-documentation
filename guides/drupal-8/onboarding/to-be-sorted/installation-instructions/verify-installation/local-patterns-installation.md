  For some people working within lando containers slows down and crashes their
  environment. To fix this they can work outside lando containers
  (patterns.lndo.site) and directly with localhost:3030

# Local Patterns installation

## Introduction

The local development version of the CDN is hosted by Fleet at **http://localhost:3030**. This local CDN is served (by Node/Fractal) from your local environment.

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
