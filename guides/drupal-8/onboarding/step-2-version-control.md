# Step 2: Version control

You will use the Git as the version control system for the City of Boston website and to manage code in the Acquia Cloud environment. If you are not already familiar with Git, you will want to check out this in-depth Git series. The first seven videos will give you most of what you need to know: 

* Introduction to the Git Series
* What is Version Control?
* Installing and Configuring Git \(Dev Desktop comes with Git\)
* Getting Help with Git
* Git Crash Course
* Working with Git Branches and Tags
* Moving through Git History

The next fourteen videos are more advanced Git topics, so you might want to save those for a later time.
