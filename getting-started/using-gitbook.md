# Using GitBook

## Creating new pages

### Make sure you’re in editing mode

In order to add new pages, you need to switch into editing mode first. It’s easy to forget!

### Use H1 and H2 headings to organize your content

GitBook will automatically create a list of hyperlinks from H1s and H2s as the page “contents” block in the upper-right of the page. Although it isn’t _semantically_ correct, use H1s for all section titles within a page, and H2s for subheadings.

## General tips and quirks

### Moving in and out of editing mode

When you are in editing mode, any changes you make will be autosaved as one draft: you can click through and edit multiple pages without needing to save before leaving a page. When you’ve finished, make sure to save the draft! Note that the “cancel” button will discard **all** changes you’ve made, not just the page you are currently on.
