# Communication

## Slack 

* Our main channel is `#digital_team`.
* We chat with each other in the `#swe-pals` channel to pass along interesting engineering things, or to coordinate shared things.
* The `#digital_builds` channel reports build and deployment status.
* The `#digital_monitoring` channel reports alerts and exceptions.
* Most projects have their own public channel to keep all relevant and/or interested parties in the loop on active project work or to follow along with questions/answers that would benefit at all. Feel free to follow projects that you may not be actively working on.

## Listservs

The team communicates internally and externally via Google Group listservs:

* [digital@boston.gov](mailto:digital@boston.gov) \(entire team\)
* [digital-dev@boston.gov](mailto:digital-dev@boston.gov) \(developers, product managers\)
* [webmaster@cityofboston.gov](mailto:webmaster@cityofboston.gov) \(developers, product managers\)
