# Communication

## Slack 

* Our main channel is `#digital_team`.
* The `#digital_builds` channel reports build and deployment status.
* The `#digital_monitoring` channel reports alerts and exceptions.
* Most projects have their own public channel to keep all relevant and/or interested parties in the loop on active project work or to follow along with questions/answers that would benefit at all. Feel free to follow projects that you may not be actively working on.
* There are some 'culture building' channels. Feel free to add yourself to whichever of these channels.

\*Note: This is largely used by Digital and Analytics within DoIT. Most others use GChat.

## Listservs

The team communicates internally and externally via Google Group listservs:

* [digital@boston.gov](mailto:digital@boston.gov) \(entire team\) - James Duffy is typically first on deck to respond to these.
* feedback@boston.gov \(limited folks on Digital\) - James Duffy is typically first on deck to respond to these.
* [digital-dev@boston.gov](mailto:digital-dev@boston.gov) \(developers, product managers\)
* [webmaster@cityofboston.gov](mailto:webmaster@cityofboston.gov) \(developers, product managers\)
