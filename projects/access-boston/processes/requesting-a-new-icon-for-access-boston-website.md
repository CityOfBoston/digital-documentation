# Process: Adding New Icon to Access Boston Website

Andreea will create a ticket for the icon including all of the above in the ['Digital' github repository](https://github.com/CityOfBoston/digital/issues) and assign Phil and Reilly. 

Reilly will add this github ticket into the 'Needs triage' column of the [main digital project board](https://github.com/orgs/CityOfBoston/projects/23). Issues will remain in this 'Needs triage' column until they can be discussed during a digital team sync that typically happens on Monday mornings, but periodically moves to Tuesdays due to days off.

When the ticket has been discussed it will be moved into the 'Low priority' column until the week it is set to go live. Tickets will be organized top to bottom with closest launch date at the top and further away date at the bottom. Tickets will be moved to the 'High priority' column the week they are set to go live. Then, once the tickets are in progress they will move through the ques as described on the project board. 

When there is more than more environment \(i.e. dev and/or test\) both Access Boston and Digital Teams will test on the different, available environments. Digital will move the icon to production when Access Boston has confirmed good to go on any applicable test environments. If there is only a production environment, then Digital will make the change straight to production. Approvals from testing should be recorded in the github ticket.

Tickets ready for testing should be assigned to Andreea as well as flagged for her in-person for her to assign to the accurate Access Boston staff member. If she is unavailable, then the ticket can be assigned to Dinesh; be sure to add the label 'validation'.

Digital will confirm via the github ticket and verbally to Andreea when the icon is in production.
