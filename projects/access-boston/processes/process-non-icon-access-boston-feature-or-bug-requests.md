# Process: Non-icon Access Boston Feature or Bug Requests

**For any system outages or emergency errors**, find Reilly, Matt, or Jeanethe and Carissa. Prioritize in person communication first. If need be, Reilly will enter an incident management 'ticket' and collectively Access Boston and Digital teams will discuss a plan on how to resolve following the incident management process. If this outage has happened outside of Monday-Friday, 9 a.m.-5 p.m., then Greg should contact Jeanethe, and Jeanethe will pull in the accurate resources.

**If this is a non-emergency feature requests or bug**, then the first step should be a meeting \(or at least an in-person conversation\), so that both Access Boston and Digital teams are aware of this non-emergency item and can discuss whether the work can/will be supported by Digital developers. 

If applicable \(i.e. if the work will be completed\), during or right after this meeting, Reilly will create a ticket in the ['Digital' github repository](https://github.com/CityOfBoston/digital/issues) and send an email to the Access Boston email with a link to the ticket. This ticket will include known details. If there are open questions on the ticket, then Reilly will work with Andreea to resolve these questions. Access Boston team should review the ticket to see if additional details are needed; and add these details into the github ticket.

Simultaneously, Reilly will add this github ticket into the 'Needs triage' column of the [main digital project board](https://github.com/orgs/CityOfBoston/projects/23). Issues will remain in this 'Needs triage' column until they can be discussed during a digital team sync that typically happens on Monday mornings, but periodically moves to Tuesdays due to days off. 

As a general rule these non-emergency items will be completed during Digital bash weeks. These weeks typically happen every two months. Bash week dates and priorities can be tracked i[n github here](https://github.com/orgs/CityOfBoston/projects).
