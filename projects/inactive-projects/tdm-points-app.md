# Project: TDM Points App

This application helps new large developments reduce vehicle trips. The tool assigns points to large developments based on their location and proximity to multi-modal transportation options. Developers are prompted to choose from a wide variety of strategies to reach the target points. The TDM plan is submitted as part of the transportation development review process.

**MOBILITY SCORE:** [_**Learn More**_](https://www.boston.gov/departments/transportation/maximum-parking-ratios)

_Mobility Score is a factor that determines the target score for selecting TDM strategies._
