# Registry Suite

The City of Boston's Registry Department manages birth, marriage, and death records for Boston with records dating as far back as 1630. They complete more than 100,000 transactions a year. Their pages are some of the most trafficked parts of [Boston.gov](https://www.boston.gov/) and provide vital services to constituents.

The Department of Innovation and Technologyâ€™s \(DoIT\) Digital Team brought these records online.

Add in statistics from Patty's most recent email re: split of online and other things.

Along the way, items got added to certain of the three apps, but at times they didn't get completely added.
