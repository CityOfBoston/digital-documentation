# Assessing Online

The [Assessing Online web application](https://www.cityofboston.gov/assessing/search/) is one of the most trafficked items on boston.gov / Boston's digital properties \(see older cityofboston.gov google analytics\). As part of the 'Apps Modernization' capitally funded project for DoIT/Digital we are re-doing this application. The Assessing Department is aware of these changes and is on board with the project.

Some students have done initial research for the City, find that here:

In early 2021, we worked with a small project group from the United State Digital Response \(Joan Liu, John Sullivan Hamilton, and Chris Matthews\). They reviewed the above student research, came up with product requirements, and proposed initial designs. They'd like to periodically be kept in the loop on progress, if possible.

We have moved on to the development stage, which is being run by Matt McGowan and Phil Kelly.
