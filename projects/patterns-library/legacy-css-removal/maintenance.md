Technical debt which can result in potentially faulty CSS code should be isolated, documented, and implemented in a separate CSS file. Or added to the overrides.css.

Also obtaining a proper styleguide will help establish a standard way of writing CSS which means that code will always look and feel familiar to all members of the team.
