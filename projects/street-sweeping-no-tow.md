# Street Sweeping/No Tow

The [street sweepin](https://www.cityofboston.gov/publicworks/sweeping/)g and [no tow](https://www.cityofboston.gov/publicworks/sweeping/remindme.asp) applications are legacy applications 

of the most trafficked items on boston.gov / Boston's digital properties \(see older cityofboston.gov google analytics\). As part of the 'Apps Modernization' capitally funded project for DoIT/Digital we are re-doing this application. The Assessing Department is aware of these changes and is on board with the project.
