# Technical documentation

## General documentation

This \(GitBook\) is the place to document technical information that isn’t specific to a particular project. We should be liberal with documenting our workflows and standards, and aim for the standard that any new developer could independently find everything they needed to start working on any of our technical tasks.

## Project-specific documentation

Any technical information that’s specific to a particular project should be kept in the root directory of the project’s source files in \`README.md\`. This would be things like how a new developer could install the project locally, a list of npm/Yarn tasks... basically, anything that “should be in a README”! [https://www.makeareadme.com/](https://www.makeareadme.com/) is a great reference for the types of information that should be included.  
  
The project’s page in the “Project” section of this GitBook should include a link to its README on GitHub.
