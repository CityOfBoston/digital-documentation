Product managers should work with stakeholders and the project team to determine what we'd like to track/count as success metrics. 

Product managers are first on deck to enter tags in tag manager to track this information. Developers are a back up for this.

Ideas for potential metrics include:
* Standard high level google analytics, such as page views, unique page views, browser, network, device, time on page, etc.
* Conversions, such as sign ups, participation in events (in-person or online), results in City services (i.e. less towing)
* Completion rates, i.e. if they visited a page that they needed to interact with something or get through a task did the 'page visits' match the 'completed rates'
* Numbers of things, such as orders, 
* Savings or revenue: time, money, etc.
