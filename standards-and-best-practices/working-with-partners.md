# Working with Partners

### Preparing and Engaging

* All developers will be oriented to the digital development standards&#x20;
* All developers will be briefed on shared resources (e.g. patterns library)
* Development approach will be approved by the CDO
* Approved approach will be scoped and and specified to the satisfaction of all parties with the minimum standards so the team can test that the code is what was requested

### Managing project

* Product owner/Project Manager on Digital Team will oversee communication and management of project utilizing JIRA as as an organizing tool&#x20;
*   Regular communication (e.g. weekly meetings) or stand ups as necessary between partners to understand project timelines and dependencies

    * assigning tickets between teams



### Accepting code in the codebase, deploying, and maintenance

* Digital team needs to peer review all code prior to deployment&#x20;
  * JIRA tickets should have adequate solution and documentation for updating release notes
  * Developer standards should be adhered to for code development&#x20;
* Digital team conducts the deployment into our deployment pipeline
* Partner is responsible for documenting and digital team is responsible for integrating the documentation into the Digital Team's Gitbook&#x20;
* Developer to Developer hand over of code for future maintenance of the code
* Digital Team will update release notes when code is released into the PROD code base&#x20;
