# Project management

* All development work must be in service of an issue or ticket. Product managers should own management of the projects.
* We use Github Projects to layer a Kanban board over GitHub issues.
* Kanban columns/stages are set/decided on by each project team. Automation can be used to help manage the Kanban. 
* Repos should have a red “blocked” tag that is added to cards that cannot be worked on. There should be an issue comment that explains the blockage.
