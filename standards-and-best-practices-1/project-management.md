# Project management

* All development work must be in service of an issue or ticket. Product managers should own management of the projects.
* We use Github Projects to layer a Kanban board over GitHub issues.
* Our current Kanban columns are:
  * **Backlog:** Priority-order ranking of work we’ve committed to doing. Do not let this grow indefinitely. Backlog tickets should not be assigned to anyone, on the basis that any engineer on the product could reasonably pick up the next-highest priority item. Other feature enhancements should be added to project wikis and reviewed quarterly.
  * **Next:** Work we expect to do this week. These should be assigned.
  * **Current:** In-progress work. Be mindful of a work in progress limit.
  * **Inventory:** Work that is either out for code review or merged and not yet shipped. Can also include things that are out for approval or completed designs that are not implemented.
  * **Closed:** Shipped stuff! Yay!
* We use automation to help manage our Kanban process. Documentation on the presets we use on every Kanban board can be found [online](https://github.com/CityOfBoston/digital/wiki/Information-on-Individual-Kanban-Column-Set-Up).
* Repos should have a red “blocked” tag that is added to cards that cannot be worked on. There should be an issue comment that explains the blockage.
