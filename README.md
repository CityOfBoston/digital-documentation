# Welcome



![City of Boston&#x2019;s Digital Team](.gitbook/assets/image.png)

We build digital experiences designed around the needs of our constituents. We work to make these tools beautiful, welcoming, and highly useful.  


_**Getting started**_  is where you’ll find general onboarding/high-level info about our team, the technologies we use, and how we work together.

_**Standards and best practices**_  ensure that our code and workflows are consistent across the team.

_**Guides**_  ****is a collection of how-tos and references for the technologies we work with. These should not project-specific.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you were getting ready to contribute code to a project, _“Standards and best practices”_ will give you information such as what your feature branch name should look like._“Guides”_ is where you’d find a walkthrough of how to make your pull request.
{% endhint %}

_**Projects**_  is where general documentation for a specific project can be found \(Technical documentation is better suited for the project README\). This section is primarily the domain of product managers. Private information is kept in Google Docs that are linked to from here.  
  
_**External resources**_  is where to find links to useful information and tools._“Learning resources”_ are things like tutorials and guides. _“Reference links”_ tend towards specs, references, and tools.
